# EUSIPCO2023

This repository contains information related to the paper "DEEP LEARNING MODELS FOR GUNSHOT DETECTION IN THE ALBUFERA NATURAL PARK" submitted to EUSIPCO 2023.

The whole test dataset is available at "Audio_test.zip".

There are four folders containing some selected audio samples from the test dataset. These audio samples have been used to generate Fig.2 of the submitted paper.

There is also a notebook called "Albufera_gunshots_testset.ipynb" showing the waveform and the Mel spectrogram of four different audio samples (you can also listen to them), each corresponding to one of the outcomes of the DL model: True and False Positive, and True and false Negative.
